# Screenwriter App

This is a full-stack WYSIWYG screenwriting application bootstrapped using create-next-app. It uses the Tiptap editor framework to create custom block-level components that supports proper screenplay formating, the OpenAI API for live feedback via the OpenAI API, and a secure backend for managing user accounts and saving work.

## Features
Screenplay Editor using custom TipTap extensions: Block-level formatting for scene headers, action, dialogue, character names, and more, structured according to industry-standard screenplay format.

AI Feedback via the OpenAI API for real-time insights, suggestions, or critiques on user-selected text.

Authentication using JWTs with input validation using express-validator.

Data storage for user accounts and screenplay drafts using a PostgreSQL in Supabase

RESTful API built with Express, Sequelize, and Node.js for the backend and a Next.js frontend.
